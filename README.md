Looking at a survey of lung cancer patients and using their risk factor levels to determine which factors lead to low/medium/high levels of cancer. Use the data to look at how key risk factors like gender, age, alcohol/smoking, air pollution, weight/diet lead to certain cancer levels.  Stratifying patient groups to understand if there are different risk factor patterns in subgroups such as non-smokers, young patients, etc. 
1. **How do the risk factors differ for different age groups of patients?**
    The older group of patients averaged higher levels of risk factors than younger and middle aged groups. 
2. **How do the risk factors differ for male vs female patients?**
    Men reported higher risk factors than women, on average. 
3. **What is the relation of pollution to the level of cancer in patients?**
    Patients who reported higher levels of air pollution tended to have higher levels of cancer. The correlation between air pollution and level of cancer was closer to 1 than not, so there is a positive correlation between the two, but the p-value indicated that this data was not satistically significant. 
4. **What is the relation of smoking habits to the level of cancer in patients?**
    Patients who smoked more had higher levels of cancer on average. The correlation between smoking and level of cancer was closer to 1, so there is a postive correlation between the two, but the p-value indicated that this data was not satistically significant. 

In conclusion, older men had the highest level of risk factors. Air pollution and smoking had a positive with higher levels of lung cancer. 

We used tutors, home work assignements, and each other to produce this project. The final project is a mix of all of our code.
